# Reign of the Undead - REVOLUTION - Script files
These are the script files used in the popular Zombie Survival Mod RotU-Revolution, the successor of the famous Reign of the Undead Mod.

Visit us at https://rotu-revolution.com

## How to run the scripts
Since the source files are not open to the public, you will have to rely on manually downloading the resources from our developer station.

These have to be put into a mod folder, just like any other CoD4 mod.

**Please keep in mind that these files might not always be up-2-date with this repository, but usually they SHOULD be**

* Images [2d.iwd] (http://dl.survival-and-obliteration.com/cod4dl.php?s=rotu_r_dev&file=/mods/rotu-r-alpha/2d.iwd)
* Sounds [sound.iwd] (http://dl.survival-and-obliteration.com/cod4dl.php?s=rotu_r_dev&file=/mods/rotu-r-alpha/sound.iwd)
* Client CFG [ccfg.iwd] (http://dl.survival-and-obliteration.com/cod4dl.php?s=rotu_r_dev&file=/mods/rotu-r-alpha/ccfg.iwd)
* Weapons [weapons.iwd] (http://dl.survival-and-obliteration.com/cod4dl.php?s=rotu_r_dev&file=/mods/rotu-r-alpha/weapons.iwd)
* Map Scripts [rotu_svr_mapscripts.iwd] (http://dl.survival-and-obliteration.com/cod4dl.php?s=rotu_r_dev&file=/mods/rotu-r-alpha/rotu_svr_mapscripts.iwd)
* Mod File [mod.ff] (http://dl.survival-and-obliteration.com/cod4dl.php?s=rotu_r_dev&file=/mods/rotu-r-alpha/mod.ff)
* The configs from the normal release can be used (downloadable on our project page, link at the top), unless noted otherwise

In order to run these scripts, the content of this repository has to be put into your mods folder. Using the *players/_players.gsc* as an example, it should be located here:

`cod4-server-directory/mods/rotu-r-alpha/scripts/players/_players.gsc`
